# .tfstate files
# we don't have these right now because terraform state is backed up to terraform cloud
# as illustrated even with resources and variables flagged with senstive = true, the tfstate files will still have this sensitive data
# It is ideal to put the state on secure cloud (like terraform cloud).  The tfstate has been excluded from the git repo as shown below:
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.*

# Crash log files
crash.log

# Ansible
*.retry

# terraform tfvars files. These have sensitive variable information.
